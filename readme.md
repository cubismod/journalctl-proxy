# Journalctl proxy

This app exposes your systemd logs to web via web interface.

- Serves as a proxy that reroutes new messages on journalctl to web interface.
- When you load the page all available running services are listed in dropdown.
- You can switch between them and previous logs are still being preserved.
- Once you switch to another service you will stop receiving updates from the previous one.
